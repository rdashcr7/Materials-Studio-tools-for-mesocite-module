# Materials-Studio-tools-for-mesocite-module
These codes can be used as additional tool for preparing mesostructure files and extraction of data from the trajectory files.

In this repository, you will find Perl scripts which can be used to a) make closed cyclic structures within mesomolecules b) break bonds between two types of beads in a mesostructure c) store the coordinates of a set of beads in a trajectory document (xtd).You will also find MATLAB scripts that can be used to analyze the extracted data from the trajectory document. The codes are mainly meant for peptide/protein mesomolecule.
